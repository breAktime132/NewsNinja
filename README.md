An app that delivers both non-biased and general news articles.

NewsNinja was born out of an incentive for unbiased information. Beginning during the U.S. election of 2020, me and several others realized the importance of unopinionated data. So, in the age of instant information, NewsNinja is born.

This app is completely free to use, and will not be published as an official app due to the community-sourced nature of this project. This code can be edited freely and is completely open-source. Authors are acknowledged below.

You may notice that not all of the app contains unbiased sources. This is intentional. Unfortunately, the limitations created by NewsAPI.org means that we are unable to filter categories within sources. That means the categories you select at the top are top headlines for business, technology, etc. but are not restricted to the sources we have limited the main stream (not categorized) to. This will also give you a chance to see all the information, with the advantage of getting the "good stuff" right at your home screen.
